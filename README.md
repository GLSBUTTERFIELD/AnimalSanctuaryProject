# AnimalSanctuaryProject

# Overview
This program models an animal sanctuary that houses three types of animals: cows, parrots, and wolves. Users can only add cows, parrots, and wolves and cannot add more animals once the sanctuary is full. The sanctuary has an attendant who feeds each animal a randomized amount of food. 

When a user runs the program, they are greeted by a menu with options to:<ol><li>list the animals in the sanctuary</li><li>add an animal to the sanctuary:</li><ul><li>choose the animal type</li><li>name the animal</li></ul><li>start attendant rounds to feed the animals</li><li>exit the program</li></ol>

The animals are very happy when they are fed. They show appreciation by making their animal noise and thanking the attendant for the amount of food provided.

# Lessons Learned
This project seemed much harder and more involved than last week's homework, but the UML diagram (and our instructors) were so helpful. I found that the concise visual representation of the multiple classes, their relationships, and what they should include in the UML diagram was easier than reading through the instruction text. 

I think I'm finally wrapping my mind around the fact that anything can become a reference Object with it's own data type (I hope I'm using the correct terminology). I still struggle to figure out which object is calling which constructor/method, especially now that we're using superclasses and subclasses, but the error messages and color themes in Eclipse help. Thank goodness for the Eclipse source menu and having the compiler create getters/setters, toStrings, Overrides, and constructors with the click of a button, and the keyboard shortcuts are soo useful!

I appreciate having labs and drills throughout the week that use similar concepts and equations that I can look back on when completing the homework independently. I will continue trusting the process and going back to reread previous chapters to ensure I am keeping up with the fast pace of the class.
